James stumbled out of bed, glancing at the clock. Holy shit I overslept! he yelled, kicking the wall in frustration. He had a crucial meeting at work and no time for the usual routine.In his rush, he spilled coffee on his only clean shirt. What the fuck he cursed, quickly swapping it out. As he sprinted to the door, he realized he had left his wallet on the kitchen counter. Dumbass, he muttered, feeling the stress build. Finally, he made it to his car, but luck wasn’t on his side—his tire was flat. Are you shit kidding me? he shouted, kicking the tire like that would magically fix it. He called for a ride-share, knowing he’d face Amanda, his boss, who had no patience for tardiness.Arriving at the office late, he found Amanda waiting for him with her arms crossed. You’re late again, James! What’s your excuse this time? she barked.Sorry, I had a pussy morning, he replied, trying to keep his cool.Save it. If you don’t get your act together, I’ll have to find someone else. I’m done with your shit, she snapped before walking away.As he sat at his desk, he thought, What a shit day. Should I just quit? The idea lingered in his mind as he tried to focus.James walked to his desk, feeling defeated. What a shit day this is turning out to be, he thought, wondering if he should finally start looking for a new job.
